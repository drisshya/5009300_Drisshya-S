Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential:

Efficiency: Managing a large inventory involves frequent operations like adding new products, updating existing ones, and deleting obsolete entries. Efficient data structures and algorithms ensure that these operations are performed quickly and with minimal computational resources.

Scalability: As the inventory grows, the system must handle a larger volume of data efficiently. Effective data structures can scale with the growth of data without significant performance degradation.

Search and Retrieval: Quick search and retrieval of product information are crucial. Good data structures facilitate fast lookups, which is essential for real-time inventory management.

Types of Data Structures Suitable:

HashMap (or Dictionary): Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Itâ€™s ideal for fast access to products by their unique productId.

ArrayList (or List): Useful for storing products in an ordered manner, but has O(n) time complexity for search operations since it may require scanning through the list.

Binary Search Tree (BST): Allows for O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, but balancing is required to maintain optimal performance.

Analysis

Time Complexity:

Add Operation: For HashMap, the time complexity is O(1) on average because it uses hashing for fast insertion.

Update Operation: The time complexity is O(1) on average since it involves a lookup followed by an update, both of which are efficient in HashMap.

Delete Operation: The time complexity is O(1) on average, as it involves removing an entry by key, which is efficiently handled by HashMap.

Optimization:

HashMap Performance: Ensure that the load factor and initial capacity are set appropriately to minimize the chances of collisions and rehashing.

Memory Management: If the inventory is extremely large, consider techniques like lazy loading or using a database to manage the data more efficiently.
