1. Understand Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science for organizing data efficiently. Here’s a brief explanation of the sorting algorithms mentioned:

Bubble Sort:
Description: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted).
Average Case: O(n²) (comparisons and swaps).
Worst Case: O(n²) (when the array is sorted in reverse).

Insertion Sort:
Description: Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It picks elements from the unsorted portion and inserts them into the correct position in the sorted portion.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted).
Average Case: O(n²) (when the array is randomly ordered).
Worst Case: O(n²) (when the array is sorted in reverse).

Quick Sort:
Description: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot. The pivot is then placed in its correct position, and the process is recursively applied to the subarrays.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) (when the pivot divides the array evenly).
Average Case: O(n log n) (average performance).
Worst Case: O(n²) (when the pivot is the smallest or largest element).

Merge Sort:
Description: Merge Sort divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) (consistent performance).
Average Case: O(n log n) (consistent performance).
Worst Case: O(n log n) (consistent performance).

Time Complexity Comparison:

Bubble Sort:
Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted).
Average Case: O(n²).
Worst Case: O(n²) (when the array is in reverse order).

Quick Sort:
Best Case: O(n log n) (when the pivot divides the array evenly).
Average Case: O(n log n).
Worst Case: O(n²) (when the pivot is the smallest or largest element).
Why Quick Sort is Preferred:

Efficiency: Quick Sort generally performs better in practice than Bubble Sort due to its average time complexity of O(n log n) versus O(n²) for Bubble Sort.
Divide and Conquer: Quick Sort’s divide-and-conquer approach helps it handle larger datasets more efficiently.
In-Place Sorting: Quick Sort sorts the array in place with minimal additional memory usage.
