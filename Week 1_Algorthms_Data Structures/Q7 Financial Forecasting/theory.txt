Concept of Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem. It involves two key components:
Base Case: The simplest instance of the problem, which can be solved directly without further recursion.
Recursive Case: The part of the function that breaks the problem into smaller sub-problems, calling itself to solve these sub-problems.
Recursion can simplify problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. It's particularly useful for problems that exhibit a natural divide-and-conquer approach or have a repetitive structure.

Time Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the number of years.
