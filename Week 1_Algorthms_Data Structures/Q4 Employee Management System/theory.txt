1. Array Representation in Memory
In Java, arrays are represented as contiguous memory blocks. Each element in an array is stored sequentially, which allows for efficient index-based access.

Advantages of Arrays:

Constant Time Access: Direct access to elements using an index is 
O(1).
Simplicity: Arrays are straightforward to implement and manage.
Cache Efficiency: Contiguous memory allocation improves cache performance.

Analysis
Add: 
O(1) (ArrayListâ€™s add operation is typically 
O(1) amortized)
Search: 
O(n) (Linear search in the list)
Traverse: 
O(n) (Each element is accessed once)
Delete: 
O(n) (Removing by condition involves searching and removal)

Limitations of Arrays/ArrayLists:
Fixed Size (Arrays): Arrays have a fixed size which can be limiting.
Inefficient Insertions/Deletions (ArrayLists): While ArrayList provides dynamic resizing, insertions and deletions (especially in the middle) can still be 
O(n).
